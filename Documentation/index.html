		<p><b> If you already have ionic setup in your system then you can skip this step</b></p>
		<h3>WHY IONIC 5</h3>
		<p>
			ionic 5 introduces our brand new open source animations utility, Ionic Animations, that provides the
			tools developers
			need to build highly performant animations regardless of the framework they are using

		</p>
		<p>
			The largest change in this release of ionic 5 is a massive design upgrade across our UI components.
			Apple recently released iOS 13,
			which updated the design of many components and thus warranted some updates to our own. Let’s check out
			some of the
			changes we made to match native iOS!
		</p>
		<p>
			All of these changes are made in the core of Ionic Framework, which also applies to our Angular, React,
			and Vue (beta).
		</p>
		<p>
			You may be concerned about the upgrade process due to the fact that this is a major version release, but
			fret not! When
			we migrated to follow the semantic versioning convention, we committed ourselves to publish a major
			release when any
			known incompatible API changes were introduced. So in this case, the major version just indicates that
			our public API
			has been updated. And because we now use Web Components, API changes are handled separately between our
			UI components
			and the JavaScript framework.
		</p>

		<h3>WHY ANGULAR</h3>
		<p>
			Angular implements MVC architecture to develop web application. It provides a platform where only few
			attributes needs
			to be added to the HTML language and progress with the development will be faster. It enhances HTML
			which makes all
			difficult tasks move smoothly
		</p>
		<p>
			Angular makes it easy to arrange things like dynamic loading and dependencies and utilize them as
			required without
			worrying about instances and namespaces. Angular will take care of the complete life cycle of the
			objects thus handles
			dependencies in an exceptional way.
		</p>
		<p>
			Angular contains many ready made tools and components that would reduce the development time, also in
			each version
			release of angular it is made simpler and faster.
		</p>
		<p>Angular utilizes two-way data binding; the benefit of two-way data binding is that updates to the
			underlying data store
			happen automatically. When the data store updates, the UI updates as well. This allows you to remove a
			lot of logic from
			the front-end display code, particularly when making effective use of Angular’s declarative approach to
			UI presentation.
			In essence, it allows for true data encapsulation on the front-end, reducing the need to do complex and
			destructive
			manipulation of the DOM.</p>

		<h3><b>Installing Ionic</b></h3>
		<p>Ionic apps are created and developed primarily through the Ionic command-line utility. The Ionic CLI is the
			preferred
			method of installation, as it offers a wide range of dev tools and help options along the way. It is also
			the main tool
			through which to run the app and connect it to other services, such as Ionic Appflow.</p>
		<h3><b>Install the Ionic CLI</b></h3>
		Before proceeding, make sure your computer has <a
			href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/reference/glossary#node">Node.js</a> installed. <a
			href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/environment">See these instructions</a>
		to set up an environment for
		Ionic.
		<p></p>
		<h3><b> Install the Ionic CLI with npm:</b></h3>
		<pre>
		npm install -g @ionic/cli
		</pre>
		<p>If there was a previous installation of the Ionic CLI, it will need to be uninstalled due to a change in
			package name.</p>
		<pre>
		npm uninstall -g ionic
		npm install -g @ionic/cli
		</pre>
		<p>For More Installations guide follow <a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli">this instructions</a>

		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3><b>Authentication</b></h3>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3><b>Database</b></h3>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3><b>Storage</b></h3>
			</li>
		</ol>

			unknow user. so we have to setup rule as public. by changing it's default rule as you can see in image
			below, click on Rules tab on database page, and change it rules as shown in image or you can find code below
			as well
		</p>
		<pre>

			// This rule allows anyone on the internet to view, edit, and delete
			// all data in your Firestore database. It is useful for getting
			// started, but it is configured to expire after 30 days because it
			// leaves your app open to attackers. At that time, all client
			// requests to your Firestore database will be denied.
			//
			// Make sure to write security rules for your app before that time, or else
			// your app will lose access to your Firestore database
				match /{document=**} {
						allow read, write: if true;

		<h3>Follow the instructions closely and it will work smoothly!
		</h3>
		<p>Create and confirm your free Stripe account</p>
		<p>Creating a Stripe account is free and you can delete it anytime. If you already have a Stripe account (for
			another
			project), it's better to create a new one to avoid any interference.
			<br>
			Note that right now, once you have configured your Stripe account in your Sharetribe marketplace, you won't
			be able to
			change it to another one. You can always update all details (bank account, account name...) in your Stripe
			dashboard but
			using another new account later isn't possible for the time being.
			<br>
			To create your Stripe account:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Go to <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/register">https://dashboard.stripe.com/register</a></li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe1.png" alt="" width="100%">
			<li>Fill in the required fields, then create your Stripe account</li>
			<p></p>
			<p>Great! You can skip the first question by clicking "Skip for now" and you now have to confirm your Stripe
				email to
				confirm your account.
			</p>
			<p></p>
			<h3>Confirm your Stripe account</h3>
			<p>To confirm your Stripe email and account:</p>
			<p></p>
			<li>Check your email inbox and look for a confirmation email sent from Stripe (by <a
					href="mailto:support@stripe.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
					target="_blank"><i>support@stripe.com</i></a>) named <i>Confirm your Stripe
					email address!</i>
			</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe2.png" alt="" width="100%">
			<li>Click the confirmation link in this email and log in with your credentials recently created</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe3.jpeg" alt="" width="100%">
			<p>Yeah! Your Stripe account is now confirmed. You should now activate it to be able to receive money via
				this Stripe
				account.</p>
			<h3><b>Activate your Stripe account
				</b></h3>
			<p>As you will receive money from your users via your Stripe account, you have to provide some details such
				as your address
				and your bank account. This data is secured by Stripe and won't be shared with anyone.
			</p>
			<p>To activate your Stripe account:</p>
			<li>Log in your Stripe account and click the Activate your account link in the left menu.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe4.png" alt="" width="100%">


			<li>Complete all the fields according to the instructions and set <i>Your website</i> to your Sharetribe
				marketplace
				address when asked. It's OK to activate your account as an individual, you don't need a company ID.
				Stripe may
				review your account later but you are able to activate it immediately.</li>
			<li>The activation form varies based on your country, so select that first!</li>
			<li>Any doubts or questions? <a href="mailto:help@sharetribe.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
					target="_blank">Contact Sharetribe's support</a>.</li>
			<li>Once completed, click "Activate account".</li>
			<li>Your Stripe account may still need to be reviewed by Stripe. It's automatic, and it should be a very
				quick
				process.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe5.png" alt="" width="100%">
			<li>After the automatic activation process, you may need to provide additional information to Stripe for
				identity
				verification. If you get this notification, click on "Review" on the dashboard as shown below. If you
				are not prompted
				for additional information, you can move to the next step.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe6.png" alt="" width="100%">
			<p>Good job! Now you need to enable Connect in your platform so your sellers can add their bank details in
				their settings.
			</p>
			<h3>Enable Stripe Connect in your platform</h3>
			<p>Sharetribe uses the Stripe Connect features with Custom Accounts and you have to enable it to enjoy those
				features.</p>
			<p><b>This step is important: without this step, providers will not be able to receive money and buyers will
					not be able to
					start any transaction.
				</b></p>
			<h3>To enable Stripe Connect:</h3>
			<li>Click the Connect left menu item.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe7.png" alt="" width="100%">
			<li>Click the Get started button.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe8.png" alt="" width="100%">
			<li>Select "Build a platform or marketplace" from the prompt.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe9.png" alt="" width="100%">
			<p>At this point, Stripe may have to review your account. If that's the case, <a
					href="https://help.sharetribe.com/sharetribe-go-payments-and-transactions/online-payments-with-stripe/how-to-apply-for-stripe-connect-review-us-accounts-only">you
					can learn more about this process here</a>.</p>
			<li>After a few seconds or the review process, you should see your Connect dashboard. From the left sidebar,
				go to
				<i>Settings</i> then <i>Connect settings</i>, at <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings"
					rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings</a>
			</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe10.png" alt="" width="100%">

			<li>Make sure that <i>Custom</i> is enabled in the <i>Account types</i> section.&nbsp;</li>
			<li>If you see a message on this screen that your platform profile needs to be completed, click "Start" on
				the
				notification and provide the additional information required.&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Stripe may still need to review your platform and account details. However, you can already move to the
				next
				step.&nbsp;</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe11.png" alt="" width="100%">
			<p>Great! You now have to get your API keys and input them into your marketplace.</p>
			<h3>Get your API keys from Stripe and add them to your Sharetribe marketplace</h3>
			<p>API keys are some text strings that have one technical purpose: link your Sharetribe marketplace with
				your Stripe
				account, so you can manage payments in your marketplace.</p>
			<p>First, get your API keys from Stripe:</p>
			<li>Click "Developers" → "API Keys" in the left menu item.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe12.png" alt="" width="100%">
			<li>Make sure that <b>you are not using test data</b>. If this is the case, switch the <i>View test data</i>
				toggle.
				Test API keys will <b>not</b> work in your Sharetribe marketplace.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe13.png" alt="" width="100%">
			<li>Copy the value from the <i>Publishable key</i> row, from the <i>Token</i> column. It should look like
				<code>pk_live_somelongrandomvaluelikeVqFze9etc</code>&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Go back to your Stripe account, in the API tab and click the Reveal live key token button.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe15.png" alt="" width="100%">

			<li>A new window will pop up with the secret key. <b>Note: You won't be able to see the key again after
					this. Make
					sure you copy it and save it somewhere safe and private.</b>
			</li>
			<li>Copy the value of the <i>Secret key</i>. It should look like
				sk_live_somelongrandomvaluelike0Rx3jvetc&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Paste this key to environment file </li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripeenv.png" alt="" width="100%">
			<p>That's it! You have now connected your Stripe account and are ready to receive payments in your app!</p>
